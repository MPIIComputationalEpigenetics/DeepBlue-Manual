# Exploring the Data

In this section, we will present two ways to explore the DeepBlue Metadata, that are organized in [controlled vocabularies](../02-data-types/02-03-controlled-vocabulary.md) and the Data, that are organized in [Experiments](../02-data-types/02-01-experiments.md) and [annotations](../02-data-types/02-02-annotations.md).

Each Controlled Vocabulary, Experiments, and Annotations have a [listing](03-01-listing.md) operation.
Although the [listing](03-01-listing.md) commands provides an easy interface for listing the Experiments, Annotations, and Controlled Vocabularies content, it is not possible to filter the lists contents and perform search operations with them.
DeepBlue has the command [search](http://deepblue.mpi-inf.mpg.de/api.html#api-search) for [free-text searching](03-02-free-text-searching.md) that is used to suppress the lack of searching in the listing operations.
The next sections will focus on the [listing](03-01-listing.md), [free-text searching](03-02-free-text-searching.md), and [data identifier](03-03-data-identifier.md) commands.
