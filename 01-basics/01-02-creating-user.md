## Creating User Account

It is necessary to have a user account to use the DeepBlue Epigenomic Data Server.
The process for creating a user account is simple: send an email to [deepblue@mpi-inf.mpg.de](mailto:deepblue@mpi-inf.mpg.de?Subject=New%20User), stating your name, affiliation and contact information.
After we process your request, you will receive an email containing a *user_key*.
Because these requests are individually processed, do not expect a prompt reply.
Keep the *user_key* safe, and do not share it with anyone.
It is your unique and personal identification for the DeepBlue Epigenomic Data Server.
