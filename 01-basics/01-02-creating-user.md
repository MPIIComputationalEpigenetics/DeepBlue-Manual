## Creating user

It is necessary to have a user account to use DeepBlue Epigenomic Data Server.
The process for creating a user is straightforward: send an email to [deepblue@mpi-inf.mpg.de](mailto:deepblue@mpi-inf.mpg.de?Subject=New%20User), stating your name, affiliation and contact information. After we process your request, you will receive an email containing a *user_key*.
Because these requests are individually processed, don't expect a direct reply.
Keep the *user_key* safe and do not share it with anyone. It is your unique and personal identification for DeepBlue Epigenomic Data Server.
