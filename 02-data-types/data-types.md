## Data types

The main DeepBlue entity is the *region*. The selection return a set of regions, operations work on set of regions, the output is a set of regions. For organizing the regions, we divided the regions data into two major groups: *Experiments* and *Annotations* data sets.
*Experiments* and *Annotations* make use of controlled vocabularies to organize their metadata.
