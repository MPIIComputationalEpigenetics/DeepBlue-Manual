## Controlled Vocabulary
We define a controlled vocabulary by a collection of terms, that contain name, description, and others kind of information.
It is guaranteed that the term name is unique. The controlled vocabularies are used for informing the *Experiments* and *Annotations* characteristics.

*DeepBlue* has five controlled vocabularies: *genomes*, *epigenetic mark*, *bio sources*, *techniques*, and *projects*.
