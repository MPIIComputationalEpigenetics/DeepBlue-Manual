## Controlled Vocabulary
We define a controlled vocabulary by a collection of unique terms from the same context, that each term contains a name, description, and if necessary, more attributes.
DeepBlue has 5 different controlled vocabularies, each one from an context:
 * Genomes
 * Epigenetic Marks
 * BioSources
 * Techniques
 * Projects

These controlled vocabularies are used for describing [experiments](02-01-experiments.md) and the Genomes controlled vocabulary is used in the [annotations](02-02-annotations.md).
