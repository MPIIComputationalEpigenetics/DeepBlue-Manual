## Controlled Vocabulary
We define a controlled vocabulary by a collection of unique terms, that contain name, description, and others attributes.
The controlled vocabularies are used for describing the [experiments](02-01-experiments.md) and [annotations](02-02-annotations.md).

*DeepBlue* has five controlled vocabularies: [genomes](02-04-genomes.md), *epigenetic mark*, *bio sources*, *techniques*, and *projects*.
