## Controlled Vocabulary
We define a controlled vocabulary by a collection of unique terms, that contain name, description, and others attributes.
Controlled vocabularies are used for describing [experiments](02-01-experiments.md) and [annotations](02-02-annotations.md).

The bio source terms [#FM: you have not explained bio source yet] are imported from the [ENCODE controlled vocabulary][1], [Cell type](http://www.ontobee.org/browser/index.php?o=CL), [Experimental Factor Ontology](http://www.ontobee.org/browser/index.php?o=EFO), and [Uber anatomy ontology](http://www.ontobee.org/browser/index.php?o=UBERON)

*DeepBlue* annotated the following data types using controlled vocabularies: [genomes](02-04-genomes.md), *epigenetic mark*, *Bio Sources*, *techniques*, and *projects*.
