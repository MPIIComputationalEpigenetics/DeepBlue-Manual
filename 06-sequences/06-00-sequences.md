# Working with Sequences

We presented in the [genomes](../02-data-types/02-04-genomes.md) section that is possible to [insert DNA Sequences](http://deepblue.mpi-inf.mpg.de/api.html#api-upload_chromosome) into DeepBlue.
DeepBlue has two ways for working with sequences:
 * [obtaining the regions sequences](06-01-obtaining-region-sequences.md)
 * [finding and counting patterns](06-02-patterns.md)

Remember that it is necessary to use the [upload_chromosome](http://deepblue.mpi-inf.mpg.de/api.html#api-upload_chromosome) command before accessing the sequences content. DeepBlue already has the sequences for the genome assembly *hg19*.
