# Inserting Data

DeepBlue contains experiments from the [ENCODE](https://www.genome.gov/encode/), [BluePrint](http://www.blueprint-epigenome.eu/), and [Epigenomic Roadmap](http://www.roadmapepigenomics.org/) projects. Terms from the [ENCODE controlled vocabulary](ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/apache/cgi-bin/encode/cv.ra), [Cell Type Ontology](http://www.ontobee.org/browser/index.php?o=CL), [Experimental Factor Ontology](http://www.ontobee.org/browser/index.php?o=EFO), and [Uber Anatomy Ontology](http://www.ontobee.org/browser/index.php?o=UBERON) are imported into the BioSources controlled vocabulary.


In addition to all these data already contained in DeepBlue, users can insert new data (Experiments and Annotations) and also introduce new terms into the controlled vocabularies. Please remember that ***all inserted data – Controlled Vocabulary Terms, Annotations, and Experiments – will be available to all users.***

The next sections will present how to insert each data type.
