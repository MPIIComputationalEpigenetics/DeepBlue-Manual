# Inserting Data

DeepBlue contains experiments from  [ENCODE](https://www.genome.gov/encode/), [BluePrint project](http://www.blueprint-epigenome.eu/), and [Epigenomic Roadmap](http://www.roadmapepigenomics.org/) projects. Terms from [ENCODE controlled vocabulary](ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/apache/cgi-bin/encode/cv.ra), and [Cell type Ontology](http://www.ontobee.org/browser/index.php?o=CL), [Experimental Factor Ontology](http://www.ontobee.org/browser/index.php?o=EFO), and [Uber anatomy ontology](http://www.ontobee.org/browser/index.php?o=UBERON) are imported into the BioSources controlled vocabulary.

Besides DeepBlue already contains all these data, the users can insert new data: experiments and annotations, and also to include new terms in the controlled vocabularies. Just remember that ***all inserted data: vocabulary terms, annotations, and experiments will be available for all users.***

The next sections will present how to insert each data type.
